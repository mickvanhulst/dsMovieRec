# Movie recommendation system
This is the Github repository for the 'movie recommendation system' project. This project was a part of the Data Science course on the university of Rotterdam. 
This repository contains the following folders:

- documentation: Contains the documentation for the project (including the fact sheet).

- models: Contains all the algorithms that are used within the application.
    - model_init_login: contains the algorithms that are used to generate movies that users can rate at their initial login.

- db_backup: Contains the backup for the db (create/insert script)

- load_db: Contains the scripts needed to load/process the data (including the scraping of the images/plots of movies).

- unused_algo: Contains the algorithms that were created but weren't
used due to several reasons (e.g. performance).

- application: contains all the files/folders that are used on the web server to run the application. This includes all the PHP, HTML & CSS files. This folder
contains an exact copy of the application. This means that it also includes our
Python scripts. This also means that this script could be implemented on a server any time, given that the server supports the used packages & has the correct database installed (database connection within scripts would have to be
changed)
